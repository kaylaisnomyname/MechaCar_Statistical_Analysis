## Linear Regression to Predict MPG  
According to the summary statistics results shown in screenshot1, we can conclude the following:
1. Vehicle length (coefficient is 6.267) has relatively moderate relation with mpg. Ground clearance (coefficient is 3.546) has somewhat relation with mpg. Therefore,both provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 
2. The p-value of this linear model is 5.35E-11, which is far less than 5% significant level, thus there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, the slope of this linear model is not considered to be zero. 
3. The R-squared value is 0.7149, r value is 0.8455, indicating that this model can effectively predict mpg of the prototypes.
